Hi, I'm Rob Turner. An ex-rad/nuc analyst and budding data scientist at NASA's MSFC. I'm excited to dive into my first hackathon project and bring my passion for problem-solving to the table. With a background in physics, engineering, and AI, I love collaborating with teams to find creative solutions. Looking forward to the experience and learning along the way!
