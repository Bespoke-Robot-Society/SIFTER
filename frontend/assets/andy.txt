Hi, I'm Andy Ponce! I’m a former NASA OSTEM intern and currently work as a software engineer at Kennedy Space Center, where I help develop ground support software for the Artemis program. In my free time, I volunteer as the lead software mentor for the NASA Pink Team's FTC robotics program and work on various software and robotics projects. I earned my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Florida Polytechnic University and am now pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at Georgia Tech with a focus on robotics. My goal is to work in autonomous robotics, particularly in the field of space exploration. If you'd like to learn more, feel free to visit my website at [andrewponce.com](andrewponce.com)!
