Hi, I'm Sparsh (Jason) Jain. I'm a software engineer at NASA's Goddard space flight center, where I work on web applications that support missions like the Roman Space Telescope and PACE. Prior to NASA, I've been an engineer at Amazon, as well an independent freelancer. I've been coding since I was 10 years old, and I've been deeply passionate about everything math and science for as long as I can remember. I started my career as a self taught developer, and I'm now pursuing my bachelors in Computer Science from Oregon State University. When I don't have my head buried in code, I like wandering around in nature, playing video games, and watching One Piece!
