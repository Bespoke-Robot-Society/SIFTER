I'm Aaron Storey, an aspiring Data Scientist and AI/ML researcher with a passion for applying technology to improve healthcare and optimize financial systems. I will complete my Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence in December 2024, where my capstone project focused on developing a machine learning model for early disease detection to enhance healthcare outcomes.

With over 16 years of experience in the military, I've led healthcare training programs and implemented AI-driven solutions to improve medical readiness and resource allocation. My technical skills include Python, R, SQL, and C++, and I have extensive hands-on experience with machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Beyond my professional work, I'm dedicated to using data science to solve real-world challenges, especially in healthcare and finance, where predictive analytics can have a transformative impact. I also enjoy spending time with my family and supporting my children's activities.
